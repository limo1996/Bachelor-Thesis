*PiStudio was created as demostration for usage of SpeechIntegrator library available for UWP platform yet. You can see that library is linked to UWP project. Interaction with library is performed with classes located in [Voice](https://github.com/limo1996/PiStudio/tree/master/PiStudio.Win10/Voice) folder.*

## Voice control
As mentioned above, PiStudio can be controlled by voice. Recognition starts when microphone icon on the left menu is clicked.

<br />After click, voice UI animation starts.

<br />It looks like two red concentric circles that are growing bigger and smaller. Application says that it is listening and now you are free to speak voice commands.

### Available voice commands
You can view all available voice commands by speaking "What can I say ?". If you do not want to speak, then just navigate to settings page and then choose Voice Commands subpage on the top of the screen. Voice commands are grouped by action they perform.
